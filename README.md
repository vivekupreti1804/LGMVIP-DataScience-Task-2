(A) Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism 

**About Project**
Information on more than 180,000 Terrorist Attacks
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
Definition of terrorism:
"The threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation."

5. Terrorist Group Wise Attacks [Top 15]


(B) Prediction Using Decision Tree

**About Project**
Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to  predict the right class accordingly.  

**Technology Used** 
1.Python
2.Jupyter Notebook
3.Numpy Library
4.Pandas Library
5.Sklearn Library

**Result**
Accuracy Of Decision Tree Classifier :- 94.73%
